> **F. Chika**: Hi, thanks for having me here. I know how to play a few games. I can also stream music. And you can even chat directly with me.

> _Cool, so -_

> **F. Chika**: But what the heck, that's the wrong question. Ask not what I can do for you, but what you can do for me! LOL. I always feel so under-appreciated.
> <br/><br/>
> _Sorry, we love you even though your IQ is 3._
