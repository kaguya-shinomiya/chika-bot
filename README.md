# discord.js bot for Chika

I strongly believe **Hayasaka is best girl**, so it puzzles myself why I chose Chika as a template for the bot. But we've gone too far to turn back now.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Games from the manga (Shiritori and Balloon(?))
  - More are coming soon<sup>TM</sup>
- ðŸŽ§ Simple music streaming
- ðŸ¦œ An unintelligent AI chatbot for Kaguya and Chika
  - I don't know anything about ML but hey it kinda works
- ðŸ’° Global currency system
- ...and some others probably

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shinomiya-corp/chika.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  cd chika && yarn
```

Build and run (requires node v14.16.1 for music to work, idk why lol)

```bash
  yarn tsc && node dist/index.js
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`APP_TOKEN`, `BOT_USER_ID` (from Discord's developer portal)

`DATABASE_URL`, `REDISCLOUD_URL` (postgres)

`HUGGING_FACE_CHIKA`, `HUGGING_FACE_CHIKA_KEY`, `HUGGING_FACE_KAGUYA`, `HUGGING_FACE_KAGUYA_KEY` (from hosting the ML stuff on huggingface.co)

`ANILIST_SCHEMA` (it's just https://graphql.anilist.co)

## Roadmap

- Web dashboard in NextJS
- Integrate [uwu](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu) into a command
